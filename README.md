Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

For this project I was able to code an analog clock that reads and diplays the time accurately.

What did you do particularly well?

I was able to incorporate a.h file for the first time and I learned it very quickly.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I would try and have the display look exactly like the example, although mine is still extremely close.

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

I did find writing this challenging as I did with all of our projects in this class. I found that youtube was an extremely helpful resource while writing this project as well as readings from our text.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

Being able to incorporate multiple files into a project will probably be a skill I use often in the future. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

the code is very simple and clear which makes it very easy to read, understand, and maintain.
